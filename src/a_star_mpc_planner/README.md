# A* + MPC Planner for the Unitree G1

Local navigation stack for the Unitree G1 humanoid.  
Two ROS 2 nodes work in sequence: **A\* path planning** produces a collision-free waypoint path; **MPC tracking** follows that path while performing real-time obstacle avoidance.

## How It Works

### Stage 1 — Gaussian Occupancy Grid

`FixedGaussianGridMap` builds a square grid (default 10 m × 10 m, 0.25 m/cell) centred on the robot every replanning tick.  
For each cell, the occupancy probability is:

```
P(cell) = 1 − Φ(d_min / σ)
```

where `d_min` is the distance to the nearest LiDAR point inside the grid and `σ` is the Gaussian spread (default 0.4 m).  
The map is rebuilt from scratch on every tick — no accumulation across steps.

### Stage 2 — Rolling-Horizon A*

`AStarPlanner` runs a standard A\* on the occupancy grid with an 8-connected neighbourhood.

**Local goal selection:**
- If the global goal lies *inside* the current grid, A\* targets it directly.
- If the global goal is *outside* the grid, the planner intersects the ray (robot → goal) with the grid boundary and targets that boundary cell.  
  This lets the robot advance toward a distant goal one grid-width at a time.

**Cost function:**
```
g(n→n') = move_cost × reso × (1 + w_obs × P(n'))
```
Cells above `obstacle_threshold` (default 0.5) are treated as hard obstacles (infinite cost).  
Cells below the threshold incur a soft cost proportional to their occupancy probability, pushing the path away from obstacles.

### Stage 3 — 2-D Kinematic MPC

`MPCTracker` solves a nonlinear program (NLP) over a 3-second horizon using CasADi/IPOPT.

#### Dynamics model

The G1 is treated at this level as a **kinematic robot** — it can be commanded with body-frame velocities in any direction (forward, lateral, yaw):

```
State:   x = [px, py, yaw]       (3-D)
Control: u = [vx, vy, ω]         (body-frame velocities)
```

World-frame propagation via rotation matrix R(yaw):

```
px_{k+1}  = px_k + (vx_k · cos(yaw_k) − vy_k · sin(yaw_k)) · dt
py_{k+1}  = py_k + (vx_k · sin(yaw_k) + vy_k · cos(yaw_k)) · dt
yaw_{k+1} = yaw_k + ω_k · dt
```

Forward Euler integration (dt = 0.1 s).

#### Objective function

```
J = Σ_{k=0}^{N-1} [ eₖᵀ Q eₖ  +  uₖᵀ R uₖ  +  R_jerk ‖Δuₖ‖²  +  J_obs(xₖ) ]
    + e_N^T Q_T e_N  +  J_obs(x_N)
```

| Term | Weight | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `eₖᵀ Q eₖ` | Q_xy=20, Q_yaw=0.5 | Track A\* reference path |
| `uₖᵀ R uₖ` | R_vel=1.0, R_ω=0.5 | Penalise control effort |
| `R_jerk ‖Δuₖ‖²` | 0.2 | Smooth velocity transitions |
| `J_obs` | 500 per point | Repel from obstacles |
| Terminal `Q_T` | 50 × Q | Drive to end of horizon |

#### Obstacle avoidance barrier

For each LiDAR point `p_j` and predicted state `x_k`:

```
J_obs(x_k, p_j) = W / (1 + exp(α · (dist(x_k, p_j) − r)))
```

- `W = 500`, `α = 8` (steepness), `r = 0.8 m` (safety radius)  
- Non-zero gradient everywhere — IPOPT always has a slope to climb away from obstacles even before the safety boundary is reached  
- Bounded — no infeasibility if the robot starts inside `r`

Up to 15 nearest LiDAR points within 3 m are used per solve; the rest are replaced with far sentinels so the NLP structure never changes between calls.

#### Reference trajectory

A reference `x_ref[k]` is built by advancing along the A\* path at `v_ref = 0.5 m/s` from the closest waypoint to the robot.  
At each step `k`, the reference position is linearly interpolated along the path arc, and the reference yaw is the tangent direction of the segment.

#### Setpoint selection

After solving, the node walks the predicted trajectory `x_pred[0..N]` and picks the first predicted state that is at least `lookahead_dist = 0.5 m` away from the robot.  
If the entire horizon stays closer (near-goal case), it steers toward the last A\* waypoint directly.
